# Image-Compressor

Another program Image Compressor for batch processing of compressed pictures (*.jpg, *.jpeg, *.png, *.bmp). I was faced with the task of processing more than 5,600 photos that were downloaded from the site they need to be optimized for fast loading, so I had to throw a program that will do it faster than each time open a separate image in the editor, change the bitrate value and save it. Need to save your time and money ðŸ¤Ÿ

Currently implemented:

- Directory selection (subdirectories are also processed)
- Image compression level
- Work progress bar
- Counter of processed files
- Counter of processing errors and Error.log file with indication of files that are not processed

# Support format
> *.jpg, *.jpeg, *.png, *.gif, *.bmp, *.tiff
